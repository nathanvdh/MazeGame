Design Specification:

-Maze game using ncurses
-Maze will be a class of an array of objects in which each object has a different behaviour when the player is at that locaiton
-Classes in the map array to include:
	-wall (prevents player from exiting boundaries)
	-Space (allows player to move through)
	-Banana (pushes the player towards the next wall in the direction they approached the banana)
	-Hole (sends player back to start position)
	-Finish (Quits game)
-Game to consist of a player class with movement behaviour
-Main function will be a while loop that continues until when a q is input
-Player will be moved by taking in arrow keys and updating map
-When player moves into different obstacles, a message will be outputted on the screen

Classes hierachy:
-Entity: has a sprite attribute
	-Player: will be a subclass and has movement behaviour, location attributes, and takes in name (string) input
	-Maze: will be a subclass and construct an object array
	-Obstacle: will be a subclass and have a virtual behaviour when the player goes on that obstacle.

-Obstacles will inherit from obstacle class and entity
-Player will inherit from entity
